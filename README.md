These dogs are extremely good with children and have a strong desire to please their owners. In addition they look adorable with their large ears, short stature, and long torso. Pembroke Welsh Corgis live 12-14 years and are loved by royal families. If Queen Elizabeth II loved theses dogs why shouldn't you?
